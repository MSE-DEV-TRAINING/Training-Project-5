![alt text](./form.png)

## Level 1

### Code

- PHP
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- No JQuery
- No HTML 5

### Requirements

> First: Download MAMP. Follow this link. Click on the download for the latest MAMP. Once you have it downloaded, run MAMP (not MAMP Pro) and click on “Preferences” and then “Web Server”. Change the Document Root to be the folder that holds all the rest of your projects that you have done up to this point. For example, my folder is called Sites. Within Sites I have my clock page, tictactoe, and div positioning pages. So I set my Document Root to my Sites folder. (If another user from your computer has previously installed MAMP on your computer you will need to uninstall MAMP and then reinstall it).

Wonderful. Now make your form.

- Create a simple registration form in which a person may enter their personal information. (hint put this in a .php file not .html)
